<p>The bright dancing lights of the aurora are actually collisions between electrically charged particles from the sun that enter the earth's atmosphere. The lights are seen above the magnetic poles of the northern and southern hemispheres. They are known as 'Aurora borealis' in the north and 'Aurora australis' in the south. Auroral displays appear in many colours although pale green and pink are the most common. Shades of red, yellow, green, blue, and violet have been reported. The lights appear in many forms from patches or scattered clouds of light to streamers, arcs, rippling curtains or shooting rays.</p>

<p>The color of the aurora depends on the wavelength of the light emitted. This is determined by the specific atmospheric gas and its electrical state, and the energy of the particle that hits the atmospheric gas. The atmosphere consists mainly of nitrogen and oxygen, which emit the characteristic colors of their respective line spectra. Atomic oxygen is responsible for the two main colors of green (wavelength of 557.7 nm) and red (630.0 nm). Nitrogen causes blue and deep red hues.</p>

<p>As we already know, nature is capable of giving us surprises, and Northern Lights are one of those surprises, they are like a dance of bright colors that surround us, the fact that a solar storm causes this incredible lights, amazes me. Every time I watch videos of this phenomenon I wish I was in one of those countries where you can appreciate it. Another thing that I like about Northern Lights is that you can see them through different perspectives, for example the religious one (some people say that those lights represent spirits of people we lost and we still remember). And finally, what I completely love about aurora borealis is how the landscape looks like when the lights are on their point, they make look even more beautiful the forests, mountains, lakes and also cities. Definetely a must-seeing show.</p>
